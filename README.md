# MTG Deck Builder and Posting App
**By Bobby Martin 10.19.18**

## Description
This is just a project I wanted to build because I've recently become obsessed with MTG Arena. It uses the free MTG API to get data on cards. The idea behind it is just to build something that I can use the HTML Drag and Drop API with and also build something where people can easily make decks. Some future plans might be to build a custom back-end to store users decks, but thats further down the road.
